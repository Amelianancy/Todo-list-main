**Note:** If anyone contributes to this repository, the changes will not be reflected in your local repository. For that:

**9.** Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.
```
   git remote add upstream  git@github.com:Amelianancy/Todo-list-main.git
```

**10.** Check the remotes for this repository.
```
   git remote -v

```
   git fetch upstream
```

**12.** Make sure that you're on your master branch.
```
   git checkout main
```

**13.** Now that you have fetched the upstream repository, you can merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing the local changes.
```
   git merge upstream/main
```
